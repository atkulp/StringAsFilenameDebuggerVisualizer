Debugger Visualizer Pack by Arian
==================================

Arian T. Kulp
-------------

Debugger Visualizer Pack by Arian for Visual Studio 2017 lets you open/view files by taking a string
variable value as the filename.

Install using prebuilt VSIX or install manually by copying the built DLL
(ArianKulp.DebuggerExtensions.dll) to \$UserProfileStudio 2017.

You can also add this extension from the **Tools | Extensions and Updates** menu 
in Visual Studio or from the [Visual Studio Gallery](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ArianKulp.DebuggerVisualizerPackbyArian).

Note, this actually adds multiple visualizers so you can locate the file in Windows Explorer, open the file in Visual
Studio (without adding it to the project/solution), or in Notepad.
